# Petroleum 365 — Copilot Progress Log

## Project Overview
Building **Petroleum 365 (P365)** — an Excel/Office.js add-in for petroleum engineering.
Reference guide: [P365.md](./P365.md)

## Architecture Decision
**Office.js TypeScript Add-in** — cross-platform (Win/Mac/Web), modern API, TypeScript-first.

## Session Log

### Session 1 — Project Scaffold + Core PVT + Pipe Sizing
**Status:** In Progress

#### Completed
- [x] Read and understood full P365.md blueprint
- [x] Created copilot.md (this file)
- [x] Set up npm project (package.json, tsconfig.json, jest config, .gitignore)
- [x] Implemented PVT function library:
  - [x] Gas pseudo-critical properties: Lee-Kesler, Kay's mixing rule, Wichert-Aziz sour gas correction
  - [x] Gas Z-factor: Dranchuk-Abou-Kassem (DAK), Brill-Beggs, Hall-Yarborough
  - [x] Gas viscosity: Lee-Gonzalez-Eakin
  - [x] Gas density, compressibility (numerical), FVF (Bg)
  - [x] Oil API ↔ SG conversion
  - [x] Oil bubble point: Standing, Vasquez-Beggs
  - [x] Oil solution GOR: Standing, Vasquez-Beggs
  - [x] Oil FVF: Standing (saturated), Vasquez-Beggs (saturated), undersaturated (compressibility correction)
  - [x] Oil compressibility: Vasquez-Beggs
  - [x] Oil viscosity: Beal (dead), Egbogah (dead), Beggs-Robinson (saturated), Vasquez-Beggs (undersaturated)
  - [x] Water PVT: FVF, solution GOR, compressibility, viscosity, density (all McCain)
- [x] Implemented Pipe Sizing Calculator (P365.md §Pipe length/diameter/BTUh):
  - [x] Weymouth equation: flow, outlet pressure, max length
  - [x] Forward (flow → max length): BTUh/MBTUh/MMBTUh output
  - [x] Reverse (BTUh → diameter): standard pipe size recommendation
  - [x] Equivalent length fittings table (NFPA 54/AGA): 11 fitting types, NPS ½"–6"
  - [x] Multi-segment run (up to 15 segments, cascading pressure)
  - [x] Material roughness: bare steel 0.000150 ft, coated steel 0.000100 ft, PE 0.000005 ft
  - [x] Standard pipe sizes: ASME B36.10M (Sch 40 steel) and ASTM D2513 SDR-11 (PE)
  - [x] Gas velocity check (< 40 ft/s recommended)
- [x] Implemented Unit Converter (P365.UnitConverter):
  - [x] 60+ unit pairs: pressure, temperature, length, area, volume, mass, flow, energy, power, viscosity, density, permeability, time, heating value, molar
  - [x] Temperature offset handling (°F ↔ °C ↔ K ↔ °R)
  - [x] Scaled units: "640 acre", "1000 ft"
  - [x] Unit expressions: "bbl*psi/day"
- [x] Implemented DCA — Decline Curve Analysis:
  - [x] Arps: Rate, Cumulative (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic)
  - [x] Arps Modified Hyperbolic (transitions to exponential at terminal decline rate)
  - [x] Duong: Rate, Cumulative (numerical integration for unconventional reservoirs)
  - [x] Curve fitting: Arps.Fit, Duong.Fit (gradient descent)
  - [x] EUR calculator (economic limit, with/without modified hyperbolic)
  - [x] Decline rate conversions (effective ↔ nominal)
- [x] Created Office.js manifest (manifest.xml) with ribbon, task pane, custom functions
- [x] Created custom functions metadata (src/functions.json) for Excel IntelliSense
- [x] Written 109 Jest unit tests — all passing
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly (tsc --noEmit: 0 errors)
- [x] CodeQL scan: 0 alerts

#### Stopping Point — Session 1
Good stopping point after PVT + Pipe Sizing + DCA + Unit Converter + tests.

#### Next Session — Session 2 (Planned)
